(This site is currently under development and is based on the Al-Folio Jekyll theme.)

I am a junior at Colgate University studying Applied Mathematics and Physics. I am interested in studying mathematical modeling and data analysis. I have a strong background in computer science and computational methods used in simulation and optimization.

During the summer of 2024, I worked as an intern in the Corporate Treasury group at Pfizer in the summer of 2024, where I learned about the financial markets through internal and external meetings, weekly teaching sessions, and working closely with team members on various projects. From this experience, I gained an appreciation of mathemaical methods used in finance.

My hobbies include playing tennis, paddle, table tennis (as well as a few more racket sports) and working on small personal projects, usually inspired by current classwork.
